# microblog
Flask Blog written in python.
Forms done using Flask-WTF, CSRF protection done with Werkzeug

Code structure emphasizes minimalism and scalability by using extendable templates and using functions to represent logical sytems like forms and backend logic.

You can try this project out for yourself if you like!
